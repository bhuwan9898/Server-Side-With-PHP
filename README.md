# PHP Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my PHP Learning Journey repository! This is where I'll be documenting my progress as I dive into the world of PHP, a popular server-side scripting language widely used for web development.

## 🌟 Introduction

PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a versatile and widely-used programming language, especially popular for building dynamic websites and web applications. Given its seamless integration with HTML and various databases like MySQL, PHP has become a go-to choice for web developers.

## 📚 Branch Overview

In this branch I will be working as a team member to create two pages index.php and detail.php. The index.php will have a simple introduction about the team members in our group and when clicked on the link within each member's profile will lead to the detail.php page which will have the detail information about that team member. I'll be following a structured approach to completing this PHP assignment, covering the following topics:

### Main Goal

- Become proficient with the fundamentals of the PHP languages (data types, conditional statements, and loops).
- Learn how to store and retrieve data using multidimensional arrays.
- Understand how to implement the index->detail pattern.

### Control Structures

- Conditional statements (if, else, switch)
- Looping structures (for, while, foreach)

### Functions and Arrays

- Defining and calling functions
- Working with arrays and array functions

## 🎯 Goals

- Become proficient with the fundamentals of the PHP languages (data types, conditional statements, and loops).
- Learn how to store and retrieve data using multidimensional arrays.
- Understand how to implement the index->detail pattern.
